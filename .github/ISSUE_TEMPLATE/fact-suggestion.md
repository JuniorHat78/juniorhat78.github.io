#### Example:
If the server takes too long to judge a tourist solution, the server receives a TLE verdict.

### Things to consider:

- Facts should be on only one line
- If the fact is funny, harmless and original enough, I'll mark it with the `suggestion` label and it will be automatically added using GitHub actions. No pull requests needed! :yum:
