# [**Tourist Facts**](https://touristfacts.dikson.xyz)

Some _facts_ about the arguably most prominent competitive of all time. It shouldn't be taken too seriously. Or should they?

Heavily inspired by things like [Chuck Norris facts](https://chucknorrisfacts.net/top-100) and [Bruce Schneier facts](https://www.schneierfacts.com/).
